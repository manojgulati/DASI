ML By Pedro Domingos (UW)

Key Elements of ML
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Three components of all ML algorithms:
1). Representation
	- Decision Trees
	- Sets of rules/logic programs
	- Instances
	- Graphical Models (probability/bayesian)
	- Neural Network
	- Support vector machines
	- Model ensembles (fusion of several techniques)
2). Evaluation
3). Optimisation
